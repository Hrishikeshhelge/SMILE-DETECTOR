# SMILE-DETECTOR
**Smile detector using OpenCV haar cascade**

### STEPS TO FOLLOW TO CREATE A FACE DETECTION MODEL

##### STEP 1 : Find faces in our image (Using haar algotithm).
##### STEP 2 : Crop the face out of the image (Easy to find the Smile).
##### STEP 3 : Find smile within those Faces (Using haar algotithm).
##### STEP 4 : Lable the face if it's smiling.


### LIBRARY AND ALGORITHM USED

* **OpenCV** : It is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.

* **Haar Cascade classifier** : It is based on the Haar Wavelet technique to analyze pixels in the image into squares by function. ... Haar cascade classifier is based on the Viola-Jones detection algorithm which is trained in given some input faces and non-faces and training a classifier that identifies a face.
